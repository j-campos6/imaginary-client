        <p>Love the lessons! The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
          more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
          'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>

        <p>Love the lessons! Many desktop publishing packages and web page
          editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
          for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. </p>
